# particles_in_box
Simulation of particles moving in a box, and how statistical properties emerges. Project in statistical physics TFY 4230. 

Particles are confined within a circular potential, and the equation of motion is numerically integrated

Particle interactions are modeled with a local Leonard-Jones potential

This leads to the particles becoming evenly distributed,

and follow the Boltzmann-distirburion for velocities.
